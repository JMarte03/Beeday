# 📋  Todo List App 🏗️ 🧠 

This is a simple fullstack web application that allows users to manage their tasks by adding, completing, or deleting them. It also displays the number of tasks remaining. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS, the app follows the MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture pattern.

The app is designed using a fullstack approach:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and EJS for templating.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express for server-side logic and routing.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing tasks.
- **MVC Pattern:** The app is structured using the Model-View-Controller design pattern for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Routing:** The app includes basic routing to handle task creation, completion, and deletion.

### Key Features:
- Add new tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Delete tasks.
- View the number of pending tasks.

## 🔧  Optimizations

Potential future improvements include adding features like authentication, task editing, and due dates. There are also opportunities to optimize the code for handling larger task lists more efficiently and improving database query performance.

## 🧠  Lessons Learned:

Building this app reinforced my understanding of the MVC architecture and the fullstack development process. I also gained more experience with server-side routing and database integration using MongoDB.
